# PHP_Assignment_2016
Code for my PHP assignment for the 2016 course

Hello!

This project was basically a copy of my Front End project (www.louisvillehiringhall.com - up and live!) redone as as a PHP website.

In addition to the Include files (a life saver!), I attached a database.

You can find the database interface on the dracgenerator.php page. 

The database is lightMechs.sql.

If you have any questions, please let me know.
